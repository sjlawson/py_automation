First - you need python >= 3.6.
On Mac, best way is with brew:

$ brew install python3

Then after:
$ python3 --version
Python 3.6.4

Don't run the tests with the globally installed python, though. Create virtualenv container by following instructions in the README files under basic or advanced

Two ways you can go from here:

1. ./basic -> single, stand-alone tests. Probably best used for seeing an example of a quick and dirty test
2. ./advanced -> cli test suite (cli tools built with Flask). SeleniumTests.py is essentially an abstract class for setting up all tests while the test_SomeTestName.py files contain actual test-case code.
