First - you need python >= 3.6.
Must use Bash or zsh (or some variant of sh -- fish doesn't seem to be compatible)
On Mac, best way is with brew:

$ brew install python3

Then after:
$ python3 --version
Python 3.6.4

Then install the virtual environment module:
$ brew install ---pyenv-virtualenv

Create the virtual env:
$ python3 -m venv py36

Next, activate the virtual env
$ source py36/bin/activate


Don't run the tests with the globally installed python, though. Create virtualenv container by following instructions in the README files under basic or advanced

Two ways you can go from here:

1. ./basic -> single, stand-alone tests. Best used for seeing an example of a quick and dirty test NOT really for team qa
2. ./advanced -> cli test suite (cli tools built with Flask). SeleniumTests.py is essentially an abstract class for setting up all tests while the test_SomeTestName.py files contain actual test-case code.
